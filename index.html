            Wicca, also termed Pagan Witchcraft, is a modern Pagan religion. It
            draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th-century hermetic
            motifs for its theological structure and ritual practices.

          <p class="smaller-text white-smaller-text">
            Wicca has no central authority figure. Its traditional core beliefs,
            principles, and practices were originally outlined in the 1940s and
            1950s, both in published books and in secret written and oral
            teachings passed along to their initiates. There are many variations
            on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time.
            It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, sects and
            denominations, referred to as traditions.

          In Wicca, a range of magical tools are used in ritual practice. Each
          of these tools has different uses and associations, and serve
          primarily to direct magical energies. They are used at an altar,
          inside a magic circle.

        <p class="bold-text">Although Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother's lifetime.</p>
        <p class="smaller-text">It is sometime ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed “The Wiccan Verses” were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by Doreen Valiente at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a poem The Witches Creed in her 1978 book, "Witchcraft for Tomorrow", which contains some similar concepts.</p>
